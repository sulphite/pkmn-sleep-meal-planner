This is a tool for looking up recipes for Pokemon Sleep, the mobile game/sleep tracker, and calculating the actual strength of dishes created. But honestly it is also just a fun way for me to try out Svelte.

## Features

- add owned ingredients to filter the list for possible recipes
- display by category of meal
- sort by strength
- for a specific dish, add ingredients and level data to calc actual strength

## Upcoming features:

- mobile UI
- disable ingredients you don't have
- illustrations?
